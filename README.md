# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Python
Exploratory data analysis of global COVID-19 data using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn). Covers 15 analytical questions including monthly trends, death and recovery ratios, and country-wise progression to uncover insights into the pandemicâ€™s global impact using Python.  

### ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Concepts:** Data Cleaning, Transformation, EDA, Time-Series Analysis, Visualization  

### ðŸ“Š Key Objectives
- Identify countries with highest confirmed and death cases  
- Compare recovery and death rates across nations  
- Analyze monthly trends in the US, Canada, and Europe  
- Merge and transform datasets for a unified pandemic view  

### ðŸ§  Key Insights from COVID-19 Analysis

-Highest total confirmed cases: United States, India, Brazil.

-China: Striking early increase followed by diminishing growth rate after the initial period.

-Single-day surge (Europe): France recorded the highest single-day surge among Germany, France, and Italy.

-Canada vs Australia: Canada showed better pandemic management metrics relative to Australia in our dataset.

-Distribution of death rates in Canada (death/confirmed):

  Lowest: Grand Princess (as computed in the dataset)

  Highest: Quebec (as of the latest date)

-Top 5 countries by average daily deaths: United States, Brazil, India, Mexico, Italy.

-US total death evolution: Increased steadily, reaching a peak around May 2021 in the dataset.

-Highest average death rates during 2020: Yemen, MS Zaandam, Vanuatu.

-South Africa â€” recoveries vs deaths:

   Total recoveries: 310,037,573

   Total deaths: 10,250,036

  Interpretation: Compare scale of recoveries vs deaths to infer outcome distribution for recorded cases (see notebook).

-Highest US recovery rate observed: October 2020 (per dataset).
